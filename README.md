## 🎯 Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze customer usage patterns and churn behavior within a telecom customer base, using transactional and usage-level data. The analysis aims to identify differences between churned and retained customers, understand how plan type, usage behavior, and billing patterns influence churn, and provide actionable insights that can support customer retention and revenue optimization strategies.

The dataset was initially reviewed and cleaned using Microsoft Excel before being imported into Power BI for modeling, analysis, and visualization.

## 🔍 Observations & Insights
- Churn is significantly higher among prepaid customers compared to postpaid customers, indicating that prepaid users are more price-sensitive and less committed to the service.
- Postpaid customers contribute substantially higher average monthly bills than prepaid customers, making them the most valuable customer segment in terms of revenue stability.
- Customers with lower service usage (calls, SMS, and data) show a higher tendency to churn, suggesting disengagement before exit.
- Churned customers are concentrated among users with lower billing amounts, implying that low-revenue customers are more likely to leave without strong incentives to stay.
- Female customers account for a larger share of total billing revenue, indicating stronger value contribution from this segment.
- Despite having fewer churned customers, postpaid users generate the majority of overall revenue, highlighting the importance of protecting this segment from future churn.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Introduce targeted retention incentives for prepaid customers, such as loyalty rewards, bonus data bundles, or discounted recharge offers to reduce churn within this high-risk segment.
- Prioritize retention strategies for postpaid customers, including personalized plans, service quality guarantees, and proactive customer support, since this group contributes the highest revenue.
- Implement early churn detection based on declining usage patterns, allowing the company to intervene when customers reduce calls, SMS, or data consumption.
- Design low-cost engagement campaigns for low-billing customers, such as usage nudges or flexible micro-bundles, to increase engagement before churn occurs.
- Leverage insights from high-value customer segments, particularly female customers, to replicate successful engagement strategies across other segments.
- Adopt a segment-based churn management approach, focusing retention resources where revenue impact is highest rather than applying uniform strategies across all customers.

## 🧾 Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that customer churn in the telecom dataset is strongly influenced by plan type, usage behavior, and billing value. Prepaid customers exhibit higher churn risk, while postpaid customers represent a stable and high-revenue segment that requires proactive retention. Declining usage emerges as a key early indicator of churn, emphasizing the need for timely engagement strategies. By applying data-driven retention tactics tailored to customer segments, telecom operators can reduce churn, improve customer lifetime value, and strengthen long-term revenue performance.
